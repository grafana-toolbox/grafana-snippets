# Dashboard Examples

This folder includes a few Grafana Dashboard representations, which can be
used as examples for exercising the "import" subsystem of the `grafana-import`
program, including its feature for supporting "builders".


## What's Inside

- Dashboards in native Grafana JSON format, from https://play.grafana.org/.

- Dashboards using [Grafonnet], [grafanalib], or [grafana-dashboard], for expressing
  Grafana Dashboards as code, using [Jsonnet], and Python.
